    When I first thought about having Lasik done I was a bit nervous. The entire staff from the time you walk in to the time you leave is amazing. Day of consult and exam they were there to answer all your questions. Very patient with you, knowing this a huge decision your about to make. Day of surgery I was nervous. Once again from from start to finish they make u feel so relaxed. Dr Groden and his staff was amazing. Made me feel comfortable. Talked to me entire procedure which made me feel relaxed and not nervous. I do recommend this for all. Itâ€™s like seeing Hd tv for the first time. Thank you to entire staff.
